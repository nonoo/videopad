WHAT IS VIDEOPAD?
-----------------
VideoPad is a simple, client-server based video conferencing system. Users
connect and send audio/video data to the central server which distributes
received data back to them. This way a client doesn't have to have large upload
bandwidth to communicate with other people.

VideoPad is like IRC: the server has channels, users can join them and talk to
other people on the same channel.
