// issue on Windows 2000, but is a limitation on Win95,98,98SE, and ME.
// Calling a 16-bit legacy function could lock the system, because 
// it would wait forever for the Win16 lock, which would be forever
// held by the video renderer.
//
// As a workaround, copy the bitmap data during the callback,
// post a message to our app, and write the data later.
