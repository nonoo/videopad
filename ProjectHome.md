VideoPad is a simple, client-server based video conferencing system. Users connect and send audio/video data to the central server which distributes received data back to them. This way a client doesn't have to have large upload bandwidth to communicate with other people.

VideoPad is like IRC: the server has channels, users can join them and talk to other people on the same channel.


NOTE: The project has just started, and is under heavy development. Project homepage with more info coming soon!
